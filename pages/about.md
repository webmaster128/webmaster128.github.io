# Heyho, Simon here!

I love solving interesting problems with software. As a lifelong learner I
constantly look for new challenges. While I prefer to deliver great,
maintainable, production quality code that is a charm to read for others and
future me, I'm also an entrepreneur at heart trying to find solutions that best
fit in the bigger picture.

My focus is on building great tech. I am happy to share my expertise with
colleagues as a mentor and in a technical product overview position. Management
teams consult me as an expert regarding technical decisions. Responsibilities I
don't want include recruitment, staff development, performance evaluation and
team building.

{% include about/skills.html title="Other skills" source=site.data.other-skills %}
</div>

I probably missed all kind of important stuff but I hope you get the idea.
