- title: IOV SAS, Director of Engineering
  from: June 2018
  to: January 2020
  description: >
    As a senior software developer, I developed the multi blockchain library IOV
    Core. Over time I took on more responsibilities and mentored three small
    teams while overseeing the company's overall technology stack. In October
    2019 we successfully launched a name service on a Tendermint-based

- title: Lisk community, Independent contributor
  from: April 2018
  to: May 2018
  description: >
    Looking for a proof of work alternative I stumbled into Lisk, the first
    blockchain community I joined. In the first weeks I analyzed key management
    and signing security. Along the way I contributed a bunch of bugfixes to the
    blockchain node and the wallet. Later I worked on network security. I fixed
    a critical bug that caused a network halt and later discovered and
    responsibly disclosed a critical transaction malleability bug in Lisk and
    its forks.

    In a small team of 3 iOS devs, one Android and one backend dev we developed
    a mobile chat application from MVP stage to a solid production ready
    application with thousands of users. The work included big refactorings of
    existing code, integration of the chat SDK Layer and design of a JSON:API
    over REST backend.

- title: Kullo GmbH, Co-Founder/CEO
  from: 2013
  to: present
  description: >
    I co-founded the secure communication solution Kullo. Kullo's objective was
    to create an email alternative that is end-to-end encrypted and very
    user-friendly at the same time. The startup was funded by a grant from the
    European Social Fund as well as business angels. After 2 years of
    development, we brought Kullo for Desktop to market in 2015, followed by
    mobile apps for iOS and Android one year later. Incorporating feedback of
    users and customers, we significantly improved the UX over time under the
    constraints that come with securely encrypted data.
