    In order to professionalize our corporate structure, I co-founded Confio GmbH –
    the bigger brother of Confio OÜ. It's a fully remote development company
    employing a growing team of almost 20 people across Europe.
    Our current focus is to realize the Tgrade blockchain ecosystem for regulated DeFi
    as well as maintaining the CosmWasm smart contracting technology.

- title: Confio OÜ, VP Engineering
  from: March 2020
  to: December 2020
  description: >
    I joined in the early days to work out the idea multi-blockchain smart
    contracts based on WebAssembly containers (CosmWasm). Over the months, the
    team grew from two people to a dozen causing significant mentoring
    responsibility. I then led the development of the virtual machine as well as
    the client side framework CosmJS. With this free software offering, Confio
    established itself as a core contributor to the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem.

- title: IOV SAS, Director of Engineering
  from: June 2018
  to: January 2020

    As a senior software developer, I developed the multi blockchain library IOV
    Core. Over time I took on more responsibilities and mentored three small
    teams while overseeing the company's overall technology stack. In October
    2019 we successfully launched a name service on a Tendermint-based
    blockchain.

- title: Lisk community, Independent contributor
  from: April 2018
  to: May 2018
  description: >
    Looking for a proof of work alternative I stumbled into Lisk, the first
    blockchain community I joined. In the first weeks I analyzed key management
    and signing security. Along the way I contributed a bunch of bugfixes to the
    blockchain node and the wallet. Later I worked on network security. I fixed
    a critical bug that caused a network halt and later discovered and
    responsibly disclosed a critical transaction malleability bug in Lisk and
    its forks.

    In a small team of 3 iOS devs, one Android and one backend dev we developed
    a mobile chat application from MVP stage to a solid production ready
    application with thousands of users. The work included big refactorings of
    existing code, integration of the chat SDK Layer and design of a JSON:API
    over REST backend.

- title: Kullo GmbH, Co-Founder/CEO
  from: 2013
  to: 2020
  description: >
    I co-founded the secure communication solution Kullo. Kullo's objective was
    to create an email alternative that is end-to-end encrypted and very
    user-friendly at the same time. The startup was funded by a grant from the
    European Social Fund as well as business angels. After 2 years of
    development, we brought Kullo for Desktop to market in 2015, followed by
    mobile apps for iOS and Android one year later. Incorporating feedback of
    users and customers, we significantly improved the UX over time under the
    constraints that come with securely encrypted data.
